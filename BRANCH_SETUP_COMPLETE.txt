✓ Both branches pushed to GitHub
✓ Both branches synced (commit 81bef74)
✓ FEATURE_README.md demonstrates workflow
✓ All environments ready

Branch Commit History
=====================
81bef74 - Add feature branch README (feature/example-feature, draft/example-feature)
4056068 - Update Git SOP: Use 'feature' instead of 'experiment' (main)

007709a - Update requirements.txt (main)

How to Use
==========

Work on Feature:
  git checkout feature/example-feature
  # Make changes, commit normally
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your change"

Switch Branches:
  git checkout feature/example-feature   # Development
  git checkout draft/example-feature     # Testing
  git checkout main                      # Production

See All Branches:
  git branch -a
  git log --graph --oneline --all

Test Flow Example:
  1. Make changes on feature/example-feature
  2. git checkout draft/example-feature && git merge feature/example-feature
  3. git tag pre-market-20260128-example-feature
  4. Test the draft branch
  5. Post-market: merge to main if successful

Push Changes:
  git push origin feature/example-feature
  git push origin draft/example-feature

The Workflow in Action
======================

Development Phase:
  $ git checkout feature/example-feature
  $ # Edit files, test locally
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "Implement new feature"
  $ git push origin feature/example-feature

Pre-Market Phase (Before 9:15 AM):
  $ git checkout draft/example-feature
  $ git merge feature/example-feature
  $ git tag pre-market-20260128-example-feature
  $ git push origin draft/example-feature --tags

Testing Phase (Market Hours):
  $ # Observe draft/example-feature behavior
  $ # Check logs, verify trades

Post-Market Phase (After 3:30 PM):
  $ # If successful:
  $ git checkout main
  $ git merge feature/example-feature
  $ git tag stable-20260128-example-feature
  $ git push origin main --tags
  
  $ # If failed:
  $ git branch -D feature/example-feature draft/example-feature
  $ git push origin --delete feature/example-feature draft/example-feature

Safety Features
===============
✓ feature/ development is isolated
✓ draft/ is main + feature (no surprises)
✓ main stays clean during market hours
✓ Tags enable rollback
✓ Branches are easily deleted
✓ Clear naming convention

Next Step
=========
When you have actual work to do:
1. Replace "example-feature" with your real feature name
2. Follow the same workflow
3. Delete example branches after practicing

Example Real-World Features:
  feature/improve-swing-detection
  feature/fix-vwap-bug
  feature/add-new-filter
  feature/optimize-performance
  feature/bugfix-order-placement
